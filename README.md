# Success Prediction
This repo is a start to developing a tool that allows users to predict their chance of success on encounters. Mostly doing this to practice SQL and making databases for data visualization. Using Python.

By scraping data from [Warraftlogs.com](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/) we can develop and predictive model of success based on recent trial history.
